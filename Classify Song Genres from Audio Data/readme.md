:musical_score: **Apply machine learning methods in Python to classify songs into genres**

- train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify)
- use `pandas` and `seaborn` packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots
- use the `scikit-learn` package to predict whether you can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc 
- implementations of common algorithms such as `PCA`, `logistic regression`, `decision trees`, and so forth
